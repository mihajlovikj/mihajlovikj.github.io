            <p class="fontMedium"> Course Description </p>
            <p> This course is a hands on teaching of the fundamentals of Algorithms. The fundamentals of algorithms includes how to write an algorithm, analyze an algorithm, and compare the performance of algorithms. In this class, we use the 'C' programming language as our tool for implementing algorithms and data structures. The expectation is that you have not previously programmed in the C programming language, but have previously programmed in some other language. </p>

            Please find below the grading distribution that will be used for this course to compute a weighted average for your final grade. You will find the grade you earn in this course on <a href="https://northeastern.blackboard.com/" target="_blank"> blackboard </a>.
            <ul>
                <li> In-Class Labs: &emsp; 20%</li>
                <li> Exam/Quiz: &emsp;&emsp; 20%</li>
                <li> Assignments: &emsp;     60% (Each Assignment worth the same % of points)</li>
            </ul>
            The grade system follows the <a href="https://www.northeastern.edu/registrar/gradingsystem.html" target="_blank"> University Grading System. </a>.
            <ul>
                <li> A  = 95 – 100 </li>
                <li> A- = 91 – 94 </li>
                <li> B+ = 87 – 90 </li>
                <li> B  = 83 – 86 </li>
                <li> B- = 80 – 82 </li>
                <li> C+ = 77 – 79 </li>
                <li> C  = 73 – 76 </li>
                <li> D+ = 67 – 69 </li>
                <li> D  = 63 – 66 </li>
                <li> F  =  0 – 62 </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li> In the event of a snow day (i.e. we miss a lab or in-class activity) the weight of each assignment increases (There may also be shuffling of course material if we are interrupted). </li>
                <li> The expectation is that the assignments are fair but difficult, so you should start early! </li>
                <li style="color: red"> Late Submissions of Assignments receive 10% off per day submitted late (up to 3 days max, then 0% received).</li>
                <li> Unfortunately, with 100+ students I cannot make individual exceptions fairly to your classmates who are likely making other personal sacrifices.</li>
                <li style="color: red"> Assignments that do not compile/open receive no credit. Simply put, programs that do not compile do not do anything.</li>
                <li> There are no "re-grades" or points awarded one week after your grade is posted. "re-grades" may result in a higher, equal, or lower score.</li>
                <li> There are no "re-grades" after the semester is over.</li>
                <li> Do not ask multiple members of the course staff for "re-grades"</li>
                <li> If you are currently wait listed, you must submit your homework on time. That is the gamble! If you do not have blackboard access, you will submit by e-mail or other course mechanism.</li>
                <li> There are no extra credit assignments. I reserve the right to add points to assignments that do go above and beyond however.</li>
                <li> I reserve the right to modify the grading scale in your favor if you show exemplary proficiency in any of the categories. I will never modify the scale to lower a students grade.</li>
                <li> In class work cannot be made up at a later date unless otherwise arranged with the instructor well in advance.</li>
                <li> Course work completed after the date cannot be graded, as solutions will have been discussed (this includes if taking this course for an Incomplete).</li>
                <li> Once again, "in-class" work must be completed in-class unless there is a documented emergency or you have prearranged with the instructor a make-up well in advance.</li>
                <li> No Facebook, no cell phones. Not only does it distract you, it distracts others! (Divide your tuition by lecture hours and perhaps you will be more motivated as well!)</li>

            Students participating in varsity athletics(this does not include club sports or intramurals) or other University sanctioned events may have the need for a make-up. Please contact me in advance of such events, so that appropriate accommodations can be made.
            <br><br>
            Occasionally, other life events and circumstances occur that were not planned. If this is the case, please e-mail me privately.
            <br><br>
            E-mailing me asking for extensions just because is unfortunately not fair to your classmates. The 10% penalty for each day late has to be enforced so I do not get taken advantage of.

            <p> This course is a hands on teaching of the fundamentals of Algorithms. The fundamentals of algorithms includes how to write an algorithm, analyze an algorithm, and compare the performance of algorithms. In this class, we use the 'C' programming language as our tool for implementing algorithms and data structures. The expectation is that you have not previously programmed in the C programming language, but have previously programmed in some other language. </p>

            <p class="fontMedium"> Course Description </p>
            <p> In short, we are going to learn how to work in the terminal, program in C, program in Assembly, and understand how a computer works. This course is heavily project based, meaning we will be spending time building programs and using tools to understand how a computer works. </p>
            <p> <b> Registrar Description: </b> Introduces the basic design of computing systems, computer operating systems, and assembly language using a RISC architecture. Describes caches and virtual memory. Covers the interface between assembly language and high-level languages, including call frames and pointers; the use of system calls and systems programming to show the interaction with the operating system; and the basic structures of an operating system, including application interfaces, processes, threads, synchronization, interprocess communication, deadlock, memory management, file systems, and input/output control.</p>

            Please find below the grading distribution that will be used for this course to compute a weighted average for your final grade. You will find the grade you earn in this course on <a href="https://northeastern.blackboard.com/" target="_blank"> blackboard </a>.
            <ul>
                <li> In-Class Labs: &emsp; 20%</li>
                <li> Exam/Quizzes: &emsp;&emsp; 20%</li>
                <li> Assignments: &emsp;     60% (Each Assignment worth the same % of points)</li>
            </ul>
            The grade system follows the <a href="https://www.northeastern.edu/registrar/gradingsystem.html" target="_blank"> University Grading System. </a>
            <ul>
                <li> A  = 95 – 100 </li>
                <li> A- = 91 – 94 </li>
                <li> B+ = 87 – 90 </li>
                <li> B  = 83 – 86 </li>
                <li> B- = 80 – 82 </li>
                <li> C+ = 77 – 79 </li>
                <li> C  = 73 – 76 </li>

                <li> F  =  0 – 62 </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li> In the event of a snow day (i.e. we miss a lab or in-class activity) the weight of each assignment increases (There may also be shuffling of course material if we are interrupted). </li>
                <li> The expectation is that the assignments are fair but difficult, so you should start early! </li>
                <li style="color: red"> You get 2 late days for the class. </li>
                <li> Unfortunately, with 100+ students I cannot make individual exceptions fairly to your classmates who are likely making other personal sacrifices.</li>
                <li style="color: red"> Assignments that do not compile/open receive no credit. Simply put, programs that do not compile do not do anything.</li>
                <li> There are no "re-grades" or points awarded one week after your grade is posted. "re-grades" may result in a higher, equal, or lower score.</li>
                <li> There are no "re-grades" after the semester is over.</li>
                <li> Do not ask multiple members of the course staff for "re-grades"</li>
                <li> If you are currently wait listed, you must submit your homework on time. That is the gamble! If you do not have blackboard access, you will submit by e-mail or other course mechanism.</li>
                <li> There are no extra credit assignments. I reserve the right to add points to assignments that do go above and beyond however.</li>
                <li> I reserve the right to modify the grading scale in your favor if you show exemplary proficiency in any of the categories. I will never modify the scale to lower a students grade.</li>
                <li> In class work cannot be made up at a later date unless otherwise arranged with the instructor well in advance.</li>
                <li> Course work completed after the date cannot be graded, as solutions will have been discussed (this includes if taking this course for an Incomplete).</li>
                <li> Once again, "in-class" work must be completed in-class unless there is a documented emergency or you have prearranged with the instructor a make-up well in advance.</li>
                <li> No Facebook, no cell phones. Not only does it distract you, it distracts others! (Divide your tuition by lecture hours and perhaps you will be more motivated as well!)</li>
